# Description, approach, challenge, and improvement
## Largest Integer Program 
This challenge asks us to process a number of integers in memory, find the largest one, and store the result in a specified memory address. To read the list of numbers in memory, one register holds the address of the start of the list. Another register holds the length of the list and serves as the loop counter. Register R0 is used to hold the maximum of the list. The program goes through a loop to decrement the loop counter. For each decrement, a number in the list is loaded
