# Description, approach, challenge, and improvement
## Largest Integer Program 
This challenge asks us to process a number of integers in memory, find the largest one, and store the result in a specified memory address. To read the list of numbers in memory, one register holds the address of the start of the list. Another register holds the length of the list and serves as the loop counter. Register R0 is used to hold the maximum of the list. The program goes through a loop to decrement the loop counter. For each decrement, a number in the list is loaded into a register R1. The number is compared with the maximum, and if it is greater than the maximum, the value stored in the “maximum” register is replaced. When the loop counter hits zero, all numbers in the list has been traversed, and the loop terminates. At the end, the value in the “maximum” register is saved to memory. A challenge encountered involved distinguishing between a register storing an address and a register storing content of that address. “LDR R1, =XX” means the address of XX is loaded onto R1, but “LDR R1, XX” means the content of XX is loaded onto R1.
## Standard Deviation Program
This challenge asks us to approximate the standard deviation of a list of numbers by using the “range rule.” According to this rule, the standard deviation is approximately the result of finding the difference between maximum and minimum of the list and dividing the difference by four.  This approximation method avoids the need to take the square root. The assembly code takes advantage of the Largest Integer program. In the way described the part 1, the program finds the maximum of the list. In the same loop, a second register was added to find the minimum. In the end, we subtract the “minimum” register from “maximum” register and shift the result arithmetically to the right by two (equivalent to a division by four).
